# Agro-Food CO2 Emission Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting CO2 emissions from the agro-food sector. The dataset includes various factors like savanna fires, forest fires, crop residues, rice cultivation, forestland, and IPPU (Industrial Processes and Product Use). The goal is to visualize trends, understand the relationships between different variables, and predict emission outcomes using machine learning models.

Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing data using SimpleImputer, and transformed categorical data into numerical format using LabelEncoder.
Visualization: Generated multiple plots including boxplots, distribution plots, bar plots, scatter plots, and line graphs to visualize relationships between emission factors.

Machine Learning Models:
Trained using LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, and GaussianNB.
Implemented test-train split to evaluate model performance.
Achieved accuracy scores for each model and compared results.

Performance Metrics: Displayed the confusion matrix and classification report to assess model performance.

Visualization Tools:
Used Seaborn for visualizing the relationships between key features.
Matplotlib for creating histograms, scatter plots, and pie charts representing emission data.

Dataset:
The dataset covers CO2 emissions across multiple sectors in agro-food and related fields, with a focus on energy use and land use practices.
